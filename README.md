## Description

The Note Taker application is a user-friendly tool designed to help small business owners and individuals write, save, and organise notes. It features a landing page with a link to a dedicated notes page where users can view existing notes, enter new note titles and content, and save or clear notes. Saved notes are displayed in a list for easy access. Users can click on existing notes to view and edit them, or start a new note.
